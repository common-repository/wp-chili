Easy code highlighting for Wordpress with Chili

== Description ==

Easy code highlighting for Wordpress with [Chili](http://noteslog.com/chili/) (the bundled version is 2.2):

1. Switch to the `code` tab
1. Put your code snippet inside `<code class="lang"></code>` tags
1. Replace the above `lang` with the language to highlight

= Examples =
*   `<code class="php">echo "&lt;script&gt;alert( 'Hello ' + $name );&lt;/script&gt;";</code>`
*   `<code class="javascript">alert( 'Hello ' + $name );</code>`

= Tips =
*   Put your code inside `<pre><code class="lang"></code></pre>` tags if you want to preserve white space
*   Add an "ln-" class to the `<pre>` element to add line numbers
*   Read the [Chili](http://noteslog.com/chili/) site for many config options
*   In version 1.2, the file chili/recipes.js is the one which contains the recipes you need. So, add/remove recipes there if you need to. By default it contains html, css, javascript, and php
